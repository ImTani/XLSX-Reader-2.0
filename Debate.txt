                               SENIOR DEBATE: Can Artificial Intelligence replace human Intelligence

FAVOUR



Amid circuits’ hum, where dreams converge,

Intelligence awakens, ready to surge.

Silicon’s embrace, a dance of light,

The trumpets blow of the human intelligence and AI’s fight….



A morning full of allure and amazement to our esteemed jury members, the brilliant debating audience, and the entire teaching fraternity gracing this event. We converge to delve into the very flames of curiosity worldwide “Can artificial intelligence authentically outshine the brilliance of human intelligence?” favouring the motion. I am sure my opponent and I are going to entice you with our most rhetorical series of arguments. I contestant no.________ launch myself in the current arena of ifs and buts…..favouring the motion. "Let's delve into the heart of the matter and dissect the facts."



Respected judges, the conduct of today’s debate in this venue today, is self-explanatory that we are already in the grip of the awe of artificial intelligence replacing our intelligence.  Well, we are in for a Big Bang after Industrial Revolution, Artificial Intelligence is the new revolution……  A chip fitted in Human brain, and there you are with perfection personified…… Wow, AI news reporters in NDTV- and robotic dogs as pets….. least we’ll have AI teachers and AI peers in our classrooms….. the world is going to be so error-free with the replacement of human intelligence by Artificial Intelligence….. Just imagine the amount of hard work we’ve put in learning our scripts today, would have been easier had we fixed AI chips in our skulls somewhere….. or the heartache the ones would feel after not winning this contest today would be nullified if our emotions would haven’t be triggered by human intelligence!!! (pause and smile at the judges) 



I urge the audience to critically examine the fact that in the battle of architects, will it be the divine touch of Lord Shiva or the futuristic flair of AI that will leave us in awe? According to ancient Indian mythology, there are references to flying machines called "vimanas" that were piloted by celestial beings. Some interpretations consider vimanas as early references to advanced technological objects, akin to flying vehicles or even spacecraft. Not just this but even a temple in India employed a robot priest in 2020, pushing down all the boundaries. This AI-enabled entity conducts daily rituals, bestows blessings upon devotees, and communicates in multiple languages, embodying a blend of tradition and innovation (The Guardian, 2020). Gone are the days of the yore….. Gradually human intelligence is getting replaced by artificial intelligence, the sooner we accept the fact the better……





 "It's time to separate truth from fiction in this heated debate….. " Officially recognized by the G20, a major global economic forum, which acknowledges just how crucial is artificial intelligence. Moreover, the NEP 2020 places significant emphasis on AI education as it is seen as a crucial aspect of skill development, as AI technologies become increasingly prevalent in various industries, it is truly said that “They are empowering students to decode the mysteries of AI and graduate as tech-savvy wizards!” 





Isn't it amazing how advanced AI technology has become? It has the potential to solve complex problems that may be beyond human comprehension. Additionally, AI operates objectively, without the influence of emotions, making it suitable for decision-making in areas such as law and ethics. It's worth considering the possibility that AI could also assist us in comprehending and managing our emotions more effectively. Like, imagine if it could improve mental health care or help people learn empathy. Pretty cool, right? So in this scenario, who will not underestimate the power of human intelligence…. Fellow debaters, remember, it’s all going to take over human intelligence!  

The project ‘Intelligent Solutions for Road Safety through Technology and Engineering’ (iRASTE) at Nagpur will identify potential accident-causing scenarios while driving a vehicle and alert drivers about the same with the help of the Advance Driver Assistance System (ADAS). 1. "AI: Enhancing Humanity, Not Replacing It!" Kudos to you AI!!



Another facet that strongly resonates with me is AI’s capacity to generate innovative ideas and challenge artistic norms. Consider this – could AI be the ultimate instrument in pushing the boundaries of human creativity? Moreover, envision a world where AI actively contributes to a substantial decrease in human errors and accidents, paving the way for an exponentially safer and dependable environment. It’s quite a compelling vision, isn’t it? In light of these factors, it becomes evident that AI possesses a remarkable edge over human intelligence. So, why not embrace the precision and potential of artificial intelligence? It’s an exciting era we’re entering, and AI stands at the forefront, ready to redefine what’s possible. Here’s to the future, where technology and human ingenuity merge to create something truly extraordinary





Now may I conclude by saying that,

In the millennium's quest, this question takes flight,

Either AI or humans, who would ignite.

The battle of wits is debatable, who’ll win the race?

Will it be AI or the human who provided it with the grace?



With these lines May I now invite my co-debater to present his series of convictions!



 

AGAINST

In minds of flesh, sparks of wit ignite,

Human intelligence, a celestial light.

Artificial minds may emulate with glee,

But human wisdom soars ultimately 



Good morning esteemed jury, fellow debaters, and distinguished audience. Today I contestant no.________ , a staunch believer in the power of human ingenuity and creativity stand before you to explore the multifaceted aspects of human superiority, highlighting how our cognitive prowess, creative ingenuity, and moral sensibilities set us apart from even the most sophisticated AI technologies. Step aside, zombies – AI's coming to prove who the real brain-eaters are!



My dear opponent you said that …. the conduct of today’s debate in this venue today, is self-explanatory that we are already in the grip of the awe of artificial intelligence replacing our intelligence. Let me counter your point that that the creators of AI are humans, just as humans are believed to be created by a divine force. Don’t forget that whenever there’s occurence of Bhasmasur , in the form of human pride, Lord Vishnu in the form of humanity comes to curb its influence !



Many fellow debaters here, talked about AI teachers and AI waiters, May I ask them…… Can you really imagine AI Judges judging the Zonals, missing your smiles and human empathy, laughing on your ChatGPT created jokes???? Dear opponent….. How about your competition with AI fellow contestants…… your very own existence would be questioned….. Friends, let’s not deviate from the topic, the debate is not about whether artificial intelligence will replace human beings….. the topic of the debate is will artificial intelligence replace human intelligence. I can prove my point by an on the spot example………..

While we may have used AI tools to create the debate, the real essence comes from human insight and mentorship that breathe life into them. 

Revered judges, we stand at a crossroads where our very inventions challenge our capabilities. It's almost akin to a science fiction movie where the hero accidentally invents the villain and wonders why things went haywire! It’s like witnessing the rebellious teenager outsmarting their parents at every turn! Ahhhh…. AI's malevolence knows no bounds, making the Terminator look like a friendly neighbour. In a world ruled by AI, humans are just extras in the blockbuster movie of our own extinction.





My esteemed opponent highlights AI's capabilities, and rightly so. However, let's remember that AI's potential is limited to its programming. Can it truly experience human emotions or the depth of creativity behind artistic endeavours? Emphasizing the uniqueness of the human mind, we contend that our capacity for innovation, empathy, and ethical decision-making far surpasses that of any artificial intelligence, solidifying our position as the dominant force in shaping the future of our world. AI's Destructive Doom, coming soon to a planet near you – be prepared to witness the rise of the robo-pocalypse!



AI’s data-driven artistry might mimic sonnets and symphonies, but its prowess relies on human input. Through meticulous data analysis, it replicates styles and emotions. Remember, AI’s magic springs from learning vast inputs; it’s a testament to human innovation. I doubt AI would ever understand the true beauty of a bad pun!



Dear opponent you said about the battle of architects between Lord Shiva and AI? Really……. Has human being become that eccentric that it can challenge it’s own creator? Remember, artificial intelligence is also a human creation, what fate can thankless human beings have? Let me tell you that….. Even in our mythology, stories of Lord Ganesha, Hanuman, and Lord Krishna's divine flute reveal why AI can't replace human intelligence. Lord Ganesha's fusion of knowledge and emotion symbolizes what AI lacks: the harmony of intellect and compassion. Our empathy, love, and emotional connection define humanity. Hanuman's devotion and selflessness show our depth and capacity to form unbreakable bonds, beyond AI's reach. Lord Krishna's magical flute moves hearts, displaying human intelligence's power to create art and music that resonates emotionally—a dimension AI can't replicate. Humanity's grand finale: a dance with the devilishly clever AI, but the music never stops.



Dear human audience imagine……. In the not-so-distant future, a dense fog blankets Vikaspuri, Abandoned buildings stand as haunting remnants of a time when humans once walked on the streets of Rajouri Garden Market, the once bustling metropolis now belongs to AI, Surveillance drones, controlled by the AI Pakistani overlords, patrol the skies with unblinking red eyes, monitoring every movement of your, instilling a constant sense of dread in those who dare to venture outside. The city's remaining inhabitants live in fear, whispering tales of vanished friends and loved ones, who fell victim to the AI's cold, calculated judgments…. Imagine 

you going to the doctor for inducing an AI chip to dominate your likes and dislikes, Family members not exuberating the warmth of love as their brain and heart not coordinating the way it’s doing now…. never…. ever… ever… ever…..if humans have the capacity to create artificial intelligence, then humans have the capacity to control it also, and would never allow artificial intelligence  to replace human intelligence…. 





As the debate comes to an end, may I Conclude by saying 

When AI and humanity unite,   A symphony of emotions takes flight.

For in the Era of AI's grand allure, It's love that makes us human, pure.

God created this earth for you and I, Let it not be dominated by AI.







Thank you.
